<h2>Our roots</h2><br>
<h3>The Athletic is the brainchild of Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann, former colleagues at the fitness tracking app Strava. In 2016, they founded The Athletic with the goal of building the best newsroom in sports, filling a void for fans hungry for deeper sports news and better coverage of their local teams. In 2022, The Athletic was acquired by The New York Times Company. The Athletic is available as a standalone subscription, or with an All Access or Home Delivery subscription from The New York Times.</h3>
